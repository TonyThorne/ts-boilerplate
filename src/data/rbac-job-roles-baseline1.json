Much of the work has been done under the supervision of a registered Pharmacist but this is changing. With the availability of additional training various specialist roles are emerging. Responsibilities include monitoring aspects of patient care within a clinic setting and management of patients' medication (review, medication history, outpatient and pre-discharge counselling). This includes work where a Pharmacist may not be present.\r\nUse of this role is now deprecated in favour of the more general one, R0019 Medical Technical Officer, in conjunction with AoW T2200 Pharmacy.",
