# Quick project to align employee details

## 21/02/2023

## Intent

- Took data from Adam's salary review SS, Cut of UK emp on Teams (monday.com) and Sue's SS for LABOUR costs
- Wanted to ensure had all the same people
- At the time Adam's SS used Cegedim emp IDs where I had local INPS IDs, asked HR for both
- The filters were based on surname, and identified the differences
