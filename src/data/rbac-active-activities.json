Can prescribe against sensitivity, prescribe controlled drugs, issue repeats, extend repeat periods, prepare prescriptions for signing and cancel prescriptions. \n\nThis activity must only be granted to authorised prescribing staff, typically independent prescribing nurses and pharmacists. Receptionists and administrators should not be granted this activity. \n\nWith respect to Nurses and Pharmacists who are qualified supplementary prescribers it is highly recommended that evidence of prescribing qualification is produced, a copy of which can be saved in the user's personal record. \n\nWhere this activity is included in the definition of a position (i.e. where an organisation is deploying Position Based Access Control) then the name of the position should adopt a naming convention so that the prescribing right is clearly highlighted and the description should incorporate guidance on seeking proof of qualification before the position is assigned. For example, a prescribing nurse position should be called 'Nurse - Supplementary Prescriber'. \n\nIncludes: \nB0278 Perform Prescription Preparation; \nB0428 Personal Medication Administration",
